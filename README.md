The MDLD-based job accessibility measure is applied in the Baltimore metropolitan area as a case study, and further compared with the job accessibility measured by a traditional method. 
Then, a set of generalized additive models (GAMs) are built to analyze the socio-demographic impact on job accessibility measured by both the traditional measure and the proposed measure, with a feature-to-feature comparison. 
Finally, the socio-demographic characteristics of regions where substantial disparities exist between the MDLD-based job accessibility and traditional measures are compared via Student's t-test. 
Results indicate that for some regions and population groups, the traditional job accessibility measure is not supported by peopleâ€™s actual work destination revealed by the MDLD. People living near job-rich areas may still suffer from low job accessibility.
